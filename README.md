# Predictive-Analytics-Projects
This repository showcases my work from ISDS 7103: Predictive Analytics at LSU. Each project applies different modeling techniques to real-world datasets, emphasizing data preparation, model building, and evaluation.

Projects & Methods

- Logistic Regression – predicting categorical outcomes
- Classification Trees – decision rules for classification
- Neural Networks – pattern recognition in complex datasets
- K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) – similarity-based classification
- Ensemble Models – combining multiple algorithms for improved accuracy

Highlights

- Hands-on data preprocessing (handling missing values, outliers,     inconsistencies)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrices, and error metrics
- Applied JMP (SAS) and Excel for analysis and visualization
- Final independent project demonstrating mastery of predictive modeling
